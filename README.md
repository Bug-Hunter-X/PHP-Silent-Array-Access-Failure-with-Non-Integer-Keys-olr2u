This repository demonstrates a subtle but common error in PHP: unexpected behavior when accessing array elements using non-integer keys.  The `bug.php` file contains code that incorrectly attempts to access an array element with a string key treated as an integer index. This often results in a silent failure, returning null without any warning.  The `bugSolution.php` file provides the corrected version, illustrating how to access array elements using the correct key type.  This example highlights the importance of strict type checking and understanding how PHP handles various data types during array access.
